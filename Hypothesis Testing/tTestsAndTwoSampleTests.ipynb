    "> What is a t-test, and when do we use it? A t-test is used to compare the means of one or two samples, when the underlying population parameters of those samples (mean and standard deviation) are unknown. Like a z-test, the t-test assumes that the sample follows a normal distribution. In particular, this test is useful for when we have a small sample size, as we can not use the Central Limit Theorem to use a z-test.\n",

    "> Before we test anything, we will need some data. In particular, some normal data. Let $\\mu_{True}=10$ and $\\sigma_{True}=3$ for the underlying normal population, then use the `rnorm()` function with your selected parameters to generate 20 samples from that particular normal distribution. Your final code will look something like `rnorm(20, mean=10, sd=3)`. If you want your code to be reproducable, make sure to set a seed as well using `set.seed()`."
